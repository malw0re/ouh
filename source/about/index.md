My name is Brian Karanja. I am an Aspiring Red Team Operator and recently graduated student from cybershujaa Program at USIU. I have completed a Diploma in Cybersecurity and part of Fr334aks, a large Competitive Cybersecurity Team in Kenya. I am also interested in bikes and traveling.

Offensive security is not just a tool that can be used to describe and discover vulnerabilities in organization's in question, it can also be used as a learning experience in ethical hackers and security analysts alike. Data protection, resource retention, and public safety are all factors that contribute to the success of an organization.

Cybersecurity does not have one particular vector of protection. People like myself have understood that there are always routes that an infrastructure is vulnerable to. Unfortunately, a world where data is 100% secure will never be feasible. It is the responsibility of organizations to understand this probability and always be on their heels at any given moment.

Leadership is a crucial role in understanding not only offensive security in my career field, but a life-role when it comes to understanding problems and issues. This is a common concern in society, as many organizations are able to understand their issues however they are not sure how to action on them. It takes a leader to both understand these problems and to know how to push them into the big picture.
